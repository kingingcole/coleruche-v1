I have developed a comprehensive quiz creation and answering dApp utilizing React, Next.js, Solidity, Web3, Remix IDE, Truffle, Ganache, OpentDB, Material UI, Chat-GPT, and Vercel. This dApp serves as a powerful demonstration of my proficiency in these technologies, showcasing my ability to build or contribute to full-stack dApps on the Ethereum platform, making me an ideal candidate for roles in Ethereum-based development.
