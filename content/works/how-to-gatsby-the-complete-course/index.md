In addition to my previous accomplishment, I am currently working on another exciting project with Educative â€” a course focused on utilizing Solidity with Next.js. This upcoming course will demonstrate my expertise in both Solidity smart contract development and Next.js web development. Through this course, learners will gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience in building decentralized applications with Solidity and integrating them seamlessly into Next.js projects. Stay tuned for the completion of this course, as it will be a valuable resource for developers looking to explore the intersection of blockchain and web development.
