I'm collaborating with Educative on a course combining Solidity and Next.js, showcasing my expertise in smart contract development and Next.js web development. Learners will gain practical skills in building decentralized apps and integrating them into Next.js projects. Stay tuned for this valuable resource on the fusion of blockchain and web development!
