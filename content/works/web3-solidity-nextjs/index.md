I proudly feature my role as an author for Educative, where I created a comprehensive course on Gatsby. This course is a testament to my deep understanding of Gatsby and my ability to effectively communicate complex concepts to learners. Through this contractual collaboration, I contributed to empowering aspiring developers with the knowledge and skills needed to build high-performance websites using Gatsby. I take great pride in being part of this educational initiative and sharing my expertise with others.
